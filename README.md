# OldAndOrnate StationAPI for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A StationAPI mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that adds in a few small old features and other random ornate addons.
- Requires [Zastavka API](https://modrinth.com/mod/zastavkaapi) (used to freeze/chill enemies when hit with the Lapis Lazuli Sword)

# Old and Ornate
Mod now works on Multiplayer with GlassConfigAPI version 3.0+ used to sync configs!

### Adobe Features
Adds adobe blocks, recipes, and terrain generation (ported from mod archive and enhanced with configs)
* Adobe (dirt/soil)
  * Special soil type that allows most plants to be planted on it, but doesn't allow them to grow
  * 4 crafting recipe choices (defaults to using new recipe):
    * Disable the crafting recipe
    * Old: Craft 1 Dirt -> Get 1 Adobe
    * New: Craft 1 Dirt and 1 Sand -> Get 2 Adobe
    * Realism: Craft 1 Dirt, 1 Sand, 1 Wheat, and 1 Water Bucket -> Get 4 Adobe
      * Water bucket is not consumed on craft

  * 2 crafting recipe choices (default crafting recipe enabled):
    * Disable the crafting recipe
    * Craft 4 Adobe Brick in a square
* Special config to generate adobe lakebeds in savanna biomes (default enabled)
  * Also, lowers normal lake spawn chance in savannas (effectively swapping some water lakes for dry adobe lakebeds)
* Special config that tweaks adobe/adobe bricks mining speed (default enabled)
  * Makes Adobe mine slower than dirt (and slower than the old mod)
  * Makes Adobe Bricks mine faster than stone (and faster than the old mod)

### Dungeon Platform Features
Adds dungeon platform block and recipe
* Dungeon Platform
  * Platform that falls when touched by a player and regenerates
    * When touched by a player the dungeon platform becomes a faltering platform that falls after 6 seconds
    * After the faltering platform falls it becomes a ghost platform that players will fall through but monsters can walk on
      * Faltering platforms do not produce blocks when they land
    * The ghost platform turns back into a dungeon platform after 6 seconds
  * Craft 2 obsidian with 2 soul sand to get 4 dungeon platforms (recipe enabled by default)
    * Recipe is a square and blocks must be diagonal from each other
* Special config to generate unique bipyramid creeper dungeons in the sky dimension (default enabled)
  * Compatible with Elemental Creepers mod and Music Discs mod (both assist in creating greater dungeon variety)
  * NOTE: TNT in these dungeons is set to explode when punched, so be careful! (spawns rarely)

### Star Flower Features
Adds star flower block, recipes, and terrain generation (ported from mod archive and enhanced with configs)
* Star Flower
  * Flower that glows faintly
  * Craft 1 glowstone dust with 1 dandelion to get 1 star flower (recipe enabled by default)
  * Craft 1 star flower to get 2 lime dye (recipe enabled by default)

    * The song will not play if a jukebox is playing a disc
    * The song will end if any nearby furnace minecart is destroyed
* Lapis Lazuli Sword
  * A weak sword made from a deep blue rock locked in time under the earth
    * On hit chills enemies for 1 second (potentially freezing them for 0.75 seconds)
      * Unsheared sheep are immune to the chilling/freezing effect because of their thick wool coats
    * Has 64 durability, half the attack of a wooden/gold sword, and the mining speed of a wooden sword
